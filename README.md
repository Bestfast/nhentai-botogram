# god why do i do this

Behold, the new nhentai bot, packed with a fuckton of new utilities
that **you will never use because you're a functioning member of society
and therefore you do not feel the urge to read hentai.**

This bot uses exentio's nhentai API Python wrapper, so you'll also
need to download his library to make this bot work

## Update 2020-05-08

### **FEATURES!**
* **/random** - this command will generate a random ID between 1 and the
  latest nhentai ID
* **/latest** - do I have to tell you what this command does?
* **/search <ID>** - this command will search for a doujin with the ID you
  put next to the command
* **/info <ID>** - this command will give you detailed information about the doujin ID you
 put next to the command such as cover image (**I am not responsible if you get banned from a
  group because the cover image is NSFW**),
  titles (short, english, japanese), number of pages, author, language and all tags.
* **/start** - is this a feature?
* **/github** - it's not like I want other people to see my code, b-baka!
